Question 10 a) Illustrate Ciphertext only attack 

Ciphertext-only attacks refer to a situation where an attacker has access to only the encrypted form of a message or data, and does not have any knowledge about the original plaintext. The goal of the attacker in this case is to analyse the ciphertext and try to derive information about the original plaintext, such as its content or its meaning. Ciphertext-only attacks are often considered the most difficult type of attack because the attacker has no knowledge or information about the original message or data. 

For example:-  

An attacker has access to following two cipher texts possibly encoded with same key. 

1) dwwdfn dw gdzq 2) zh zloo iljkw 

Attacker begins decoding the ciphertext assuming that it was encoded using Monoalphabetic cipher. 

	CT : dwwdfn dw gdzq 	CT : zh zloo iljkw 
	Key: 1 	Key: 1 

	PT :  cvvcem cv fcyp 	PT :  yg yknn hkijv 

 	 

	CT : dwwdfn dw gdzq 	CT : zh zloo iljkw 

	Key: 2 	Key: 2 

	PT :  buubdl bu ebxo 	PT :  xf xjmm gjhiu 

 	 

	CT : dwwdfn dw gdzq 	CT : zh zloo iljkw  

	Key: 3 	Key: 3 

	PT :  attack at dawn 	PT :  we will fight 

 

Thus, by guessing the key, attacker was able to decode the messages. Attacker can also use strategies like frequency distribution of alphabets, repetitive pairs of texts in ciphertext, etc. 

 

Question 10 b) Illustrate Known Plaintext attack 

 

A known plaintext attack occurs when the attacker has access to both the plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext. The goal of the attacker in this case is to analyse the relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext, and use that information to try to derive the secret key used to encrypt the message. Known plaintext attacks are often easier than ciphertext-only attacks because the attacker has access to both the plaintext and ciphertext, which can reveal important information about the encryption algorithm used. 

 

For example:-  

An attacker has access to following ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext . 

 

CT : HCRZ 

PT : hill 

 

He also have access to another cipher text encoded with same secret key but don’t know its corresponding plaintext. So, his goal is to guess the secret key.  

 

CT : SSXNSP 

 

Attacker begins to guess the encryption algorithm used in encryption. Several algorithms like Caesar Cipher, Playfair seems to fail, now attacker assumes that hill cipher might be used in this case.
